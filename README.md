# SpaceX Launch Programs React SSR

## Tech Stack
This application is built using the below trending tech stack
* Next Js - Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more.
* SASS - Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
* SWR  - The name “SWR” is derived from stale-while-revalidate, a HTTP cache invalidation strategy popularized by HTTP RFC 5861. SWR is a strategy to first return the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data

## The Approach
The approach was to build a highly responsive application with a fluid UI which is also accessible. Components are organised according to the role they play in the application.
For the purpose of client-side data fetching, the SWR library was chosen for its fast, lighweight and reusable data fetching features. This also reduced appliaction complexity significantly.
